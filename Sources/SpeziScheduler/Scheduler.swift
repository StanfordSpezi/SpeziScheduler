/// Schedule and query tasks and their events.
///
/// A ``Task`` is an potentially repeated action or work that a user is supposed to perform. An ``Event`` represents a single
/// occurrence of a task, that is derived from its ``Schedule``.
///
/// You use the `Scheduler` module to manage the persistence store of your tasks. It provides a versioned, append-only store
/// for tasks. It allows to modify the properties (e.g., schedule) of future events without affecting occurrences of the past.
///
/// You create and automatically update your tasks
/// using ``createOrUpdateTask(id:title:instructions:category:schedule:completionPolicy:tags:effectiveFrom:with:)``.
///
/// Below is a example on how to create your own [`Module`](https://swiftpackageindex.com/stanfordspezi/spezi/documentation/spezi/module)
/// to manage your tasks and ensure they are always up to date.
///
/// ```swift
/// import Spezi
/// import SpeziScheduler
///
/// class MySchedulerModule: Module {
///     @Dependency(Scheduler.self)
///     private var scheduler
///
///     init() {}
///
///     func configure() {
///         do {
///             try scheduler.createOrUpdateTask(
///                 id: "my-daily-task",
///                 title: "Daily Questionnaire",
///             	instructions: "Please fill out the Questionnaire every day.",
///                 category: Task.Category("Questionnaire", systemName: "list.clipboard.fill"),
///                 schedule: .daily(hour: 9, minute: 0, startingAt: .today)
///             )
///         } catch {
///             // handle error (e.g., visualize in your UI)
///         }
